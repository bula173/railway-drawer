## Development Notes

### Critical Bug Resolution
The primary architectural issue ("when I change style elemnt container disapear from svg") has been resolved through:
1. **Comprehensive State Management**: Proper element state tracking and updates
2. **Debug Logging**: Extensive console logging for state changes and element lifecycle
3. **Test Coverage**: Specific tests monitoring element state during style changes
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript interfaces preventing state corruption

### Testing Strategy
- **Component Isolation**: Each component tested independently with proper mocking
- **User Interaction Focus**: Tests simulate real user workflows and edge cases
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive validation of element state changes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tests ensure efficient rendering and state updates

### Build Quality
- **Zero TypeScript Errors**: Strict compilation with full type coverage
- **Clean Build Output**: Optimized bundles with source maps
- **Documentation Complete**: Architecture, contributing, and usage documentation
- **Professional Standards**: License, changelog, and project metadata
