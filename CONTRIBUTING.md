2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/railway-drawer.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`
5. Run tests: `npm run test`

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- Feature branches: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description-of-bug`
- Documentation: `docs/description-of-changes`
- Refactoring: `refactor/description-of-refactor`

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(toolbox): add custom shape editor
fix(drawarea): resolve element disappearing bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(elements): add comprehensive element state tests
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use proper prop types and default values
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when appropriate

### CSS/Styling
- Use CSS modules or styled-components
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Ensure responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Test across different browsers

### Testing
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Include integration tests for complex workflows

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with appropriate tests
3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm run test`
4. Ensure code builds: `npm run build`
5. Run linting: `npm run lint`
6. Commit your changes with conventional commit messages
7. Push to your fork and create a pull request

### Pull Request Template

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports
Include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Browser and OS information
- Console errors if any

### Feature Requests
Include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Possible implementation approach
- Alternative solutions considered

## Architecture Guidelines

### Component Design
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop drilling or context for state
- Follow the container/presenter pattern when appropriate

### State Management
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Lift state up when shared between components
- Use refs for imperative operations
- Avoid state duplication

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize re-renders with proper memoization
- Use efficient data structures
- Optimize SVG rendering for large diagrams
- Profile performance for complex operations

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Test component behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Focus on user interactions and outcomes

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between components
- Test complex user workflows
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should handle specific behavior', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  describe('when in specific state', () => {
    it('should respond appropriately', () => {
      // Nested test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Include usage examples for components
- Maintain README and ARCHITECTURE documents

### User Documentation
