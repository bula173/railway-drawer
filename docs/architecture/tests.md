# Tests

- Unit/integration: `src/**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts`, vitest + jsdom, setup `src/__tests__/setup.ts`.
  `@maxgraph/core` is inlined (`server.deps.inline`) because its ESM has extensionless imports;
  `--no-experimental-webstorage` keeps Node's own localStorage from shadowing jsdom's.
- `src/__tests__/ui/tab-cache-restore.test.ts` mirrors the startup sequence of `src/boot` (bootTabs); keep them in sync.
